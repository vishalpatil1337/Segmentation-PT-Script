# Segmentation-PT-Script
Create a file called subnet.txt and include all of the subnets in it. Then, run the SegPT-Script.sh script.
```
git clone https://github.com/vishalpatil1337/Segmentation-PT-Script.git
cd Segmentation-PT-Script
chmod +x *
nano subnet.txt                                # Enter Out of Scope Subnets
./SegPT-Script.sh subnet.txt

Examine the outcome at the end. Subnets_segment1_* can be used to manually create several portions. The final output of our scripts will be final_segment1_*.
